# üéØ Auction Simulator

A concurrent auction simulation system that runs 40 auctions in parallel with 100 bidders each, measuring performance under controlled resource constraints.

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement an **Auction Simulator** that:

- Runs **40 auctions concurrently**
- Simulates **100 bidders per auction**, each making decisions based on item attributes
- Enforces **per-auction timeouts**
- Collects valid bids and declares winners
- Measures **end-to-end execution time** (from first auction start to last completion)
- Standardizes resource usage (vCPU, RAM) for consistent and reproducible behavior

This project satisfies the requirements of a scalable, deterministic simulation suitable for performance benchmarking and concurrency testing.

## üîß Features

‚úÖ **Concurrent Auctions**  
- 40 auctions run simultaneously using Go goroutines.

‚úÖ **Smart Bidders**  
- 100 unique bidders participate across all auctions.
- Each bidder evaluates 20-item attributes (simulated) and decides:
  - Whether to place a bid (~70% probability)
  - With a random reaction delay (realistic network + decision time)

‚úÖ **Timeout-Based Auctions**  
- Each auction runs for a defined duration (`TimeoutSec`)
- Late bids are rejected after timeout
- Winner = highest bid among timely submissions

‚úÖ **Performance Measurement**  
- Total runtime measured from **start of first auction** to **end of last auction**
- Output includes:
  - Per-auction winner (in JSON)
  - Duration
  - Bid statistics

‚úÖ **Resource Standardization**  
- Controls vCPU usage via `GOMAXPROCS`
- Optional environment override: `SIM_VCPU=4`
- Memory limits can be added via `debug.SetMemoryLimit()` (future extension)

‚úÖ **Clean Output & Logging**  
- Each auction result saved as `output/auction_XXX.json`
- Console logs show progress and final stats
